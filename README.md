# Forest Fire Analysis and Prediction

## 1. Overview
This project analyzes and predicts forest fires in two Algerian regions (Bejaia and Sidi Bel-Abbes) using data from June to September 2012. The goal is to explore patterns in the data and build a predictive model for forest fire occurrence.

## 2. Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **Algerian_forest_fires_cleaned_dataset.csv**, which contains information about forest fires across the Bejaia and Sidi Bel-Abbes regions during the summer months of 2012.

## 3. Key Insights
- Most fires occurred in **August**.
- **June**, **July**, and **August** had the highest fire activity.
- **September** saw fewer fires compared to the earlier months.

## 4. Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore and visualize trends, distributions, and patterns in the dataset.
3. **Correlation and Multicollinearity Analysis**: Analyze correlations between features and check for multicollinearity to optimize the model.
4. **Fire Prediction**: Apply machine learning models to predict forest fire occurrences based on the features in the dataset.

## 5. Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- **Python 3.x**
- The following Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

Make sure to install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
